[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is a build tool in JavaScript.  
Rails apps use it to bundle up "application-like JavaScript" via [rails/webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker).  

The boundaries are fuzzy app-to-app.  
But one is clear.  
Any JavaScript that needs to be used via `import ...` or `require ...` does so via `Webpack` and `Webpacker`.  
So start there.
