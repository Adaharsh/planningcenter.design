## tl;dr
Use multiples of `8px` to define dimensions, padding, and margin of elements.

## Status
**Progressive**: *Design and develop new layouts with 8-point grid.*  

We have some apps that are all-in.  
We have others with very few 8-point grid layouts.  
Don't stress about older layouts.  
Just build up your 8-point muscles on new layouts.


## 4px Nudges
We support `4px` _"nudges"_ for grid lines below `32px`.
These values are allowable for fine-tuning:
`4px`, `12px`, `20px`, `28px`.

## Borders and Outlines
Borders should fall **inside** `8px` boundaries.  
For example:

üëé **nope**
```css
.btn {
  line-height: 16px;
  padding-left: 8px;
  padding-right: 8px;
  border: 0;
  outline: 1px;
}
```

üëç **yup**
```css
.btn {
  line-height: 14px;
  padding-left: 7px;
  padding-right: 7px;
  border: 1px;
}
```
