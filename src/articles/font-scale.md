## tl;dr
Use this font scale, based on a rounded Minor Third (1.2).

```
0 = 24px
1 = 20px
2 = 18px
3 = 16px
4 = 14px
5 = 12px
6 = 10px
```

Available NPM at [planningcenter-font-size.css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/planningcenter-font-size.css) as utility classes.

## Exceptions
There will always be exceptions.  
Hero text could be much larger than 24px.  
We recommend sticking to `8px` increments and handling exceptions with inline styles: `style="font-size: 56px"`

## Status
**Progressive**: *Design and develop new layouts with this font scale.*  

We have some apps that are all-in.  
Don't stress.  
Update them where you see them.
