[Flipper](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper) is a database-driven utility for rolling out features to select groups, organizations, and environments.

## Warning ⚠️
Because `production` and `staging` share a database,  
**Features enabled in `staging` are enabled in `production`.**

## Groups and Actors
Use `Groups` and `Actors` to enable features.  
The specifics vary by application.  
Consult you team regarding best practices.
