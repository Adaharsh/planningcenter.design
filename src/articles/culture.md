## Working with Product Managers
Product Managers set the design direction for their app.
They depend on designers for feedback on usability, technical difficulty, and accessibility.
So speak honestly.

## Working in a code base
Each app has very different ways of tracking code quality.
What's beautiful to one team might be repulsive to another.
Work within your teams established style.

When working in another app, be courteous and open to their preferences but don't get blocked trying to match them.
If it works and PMs are happy, ask the team if they'd be willing to merge as is and take care of matching it to their preferences.
