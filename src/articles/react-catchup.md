## Why 16.7 matters

v16 has been an incredible major version.  
The React team have introduced tools that change the React programming model.

Hooks and Suspense give common language to patterns that had been difficult to abstract.  
These new tools require less code-motion to implement and reduce designer exposure to hard-to-see bugs.

All new Global Design tooling will target v16.7 as a baseline.

## A pragmatic approach

You don't have to upgrade everything.

The React team has provided codemods to upgrade through breaking changes.  
It's also provided polyfill libraries for changes that can't me automated.

Please don't get stuck in the trap of assuming you have to migrate to update.  
Use the tools and get on the latest as soon as you can.
