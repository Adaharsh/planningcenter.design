You have access to all Planning Center icons through [Planning Center Icons](https://github.com/planningcenter/icons) (Icons).

Icons is a collection the accessible, scaleable, standard SVG icons used my most Planning Center apps.

Distributed as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@planningcenter/icons), Icons exposes icons as standard SVGs.
These SVGs can be used, through platform specific loaders, to be used any of our existing app platforms.

Checkout the the [Github repo](https://planningcenter.github.io/icons/) for adding and updating icons.
