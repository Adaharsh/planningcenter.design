All Planning Center icons [live in this repo](https://github.com/planningcenter/icons).  
It's our central repository for icons.

View the catalog — by app — in [this directory](https://planningcenter.github.io/icons/).

*Icons* is a collection the accessible, scaleable, one-color, SVG icons.  

Distributed as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@planningcenter/icons), *Icons* exposes icons as standard SVGs.
These standard SVGs work with all supported platforms.

Checkout the [Github repo](https://planningcenter.github.io/icons/) for instructions on adding and updating icons.
