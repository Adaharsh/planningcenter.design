[circleci](https://circleci.com/) is the service we use for [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).  
Practically speaking, it's a [Github](/github) integration that runs your test suite when you open a Pull Request.

### What does a failed build mean?
It means you have tests that are failing.  
You can click into the message on Github and see what tests are failing.  
If it's not obvious, ask your app team.
