It can be hard to identify which practices are good or bad when navigating a large,
longstanding code base.

Office hours are a place to get help with our latest systems,
uncover the historical context for an existing solution,
or just get help on a thing.

Design System office hours happen in the `#design-systems` [Slack](/slack) channel,
Wednesdays 11:30-4pm PDT.
