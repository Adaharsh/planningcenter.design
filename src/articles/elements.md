## Our job as designers

> Improve user success through consistent, predictable UI.

## The wrong vision

In 2013, we had the right goal and the wrong execution.  
[Interfaces](https://github.com/ministrycentered/interfaces),
our fork Zurb Foundation, had a worldview that didn't scale with our our culture.

We learned that an important part of a Planning Center design system is app-team autonomy.
Each team needs to the flexibility to make decisions — on the ground — to best service their users.

## New hope

We've seen a lot of experimentation in an React-based design systems,
Lead by Travis and Services.
Simultaniously,
Global Design has learned new ways to maintain and distribute code used by all teams.
And we've all done a great deal of ground-level work to improve the state of our frontend.
So that solutions can be shared more easily.

We're doing great work. 

## 99 Problems

These ventures are not without problems.
They've have left many teams feeling directionless or caught in the middle.

We've observed that all teams want React-level abstractions.
But React-based abstractions have trouble breaking through to other apps.

From where I'm sitting there seem to be two reasons for this:

* React-based solutions only service a percentage of non-Services, non-Resources apps.
* Shared code requires maintenance and support that app-teams aren't equipped to give.


## Breaking up the system

Today, most designers have to live in both both worlds — Rails and React.

To better support designers — today — we need break these concepts of a _design system_ and _development library_.
System being the ideals (user focus) and library being the patterns (designer/dev focused).

[planningcenter.design](https://planningcenter.design) will be where our systems live.  
Rules and guidelines for fostering successful customers.

## The partnership role of Global Design

We won't tell you what to do or how to do it.  
Our job is to help you, help your users.
