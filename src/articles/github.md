You know what [Github](https://github.com/) is and what we use it for.  

## Workflow
We use a [feature branch workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows).
Features are `branch`ed from `master` and merged back in via `pull requests`.  
Atlassian has a great document on this strategy.  
[Give it a read]( https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). 

## Two +1's required
Every feature requires review and approval by two coworkers to be merged.

These approvals are measured `+1`s.

Each team has additional guidelines around deploys and code reviews.  
Talk with your team about the specifics.  

## Authoring a strong PR
Every team has practices around code management, review, and disussion.  
Learn from them.  
Many teams use a pull request description style that is based on this doc: 
[planningcenter/commit-guidelines](https://github.com/planningcenter/commit-guidelines).

## Todo
* Rebasing
* Fixup commits
