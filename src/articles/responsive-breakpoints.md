## tl;dr
Use these *Simplified [Material Breakpoints](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints)*:

* `xs` `480` 
* `sm` `600`
* `md` `720`
* `lg` `960`
* `xl` `1200`

## Status
**Progressive**: *Design and develop new layouts with Simplified Material Breakpoints.*  

We have some apps that are all-in.  
We have others that use old [Interfaces breakpoints](https://github.com/ministrycentered/interfaces/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/interfaces/mixin/respond.scss#L1-L6).  
Don't stress about older layouts.  
Just build up these new muscles on new layouts.
